# SolarPV-MPPT-BoostConverter
This project focuses on implementing a Maximum Power Point Tracking (MPPT) system for a solar photovoltaic (PV) array using the Perturb and Observe (P&O) algorithm. Since the power output of a solar PV system varies with changes in solar irradiance and temperature, MPPT is essential for ensuring that the system consistently operates at its Maximum Power Point (MPP).

A boost converter is employed to step up the PV voltage to meet load requirements. The P&O algorithm dynamically adjusts the duty cycle to maximize power extraction from the PV array. This implementation achieved approximately 99% accuracy, demonstrating effective and reliable tracking of the true MPP.
